export const bio = 'I am a Full-Stack software developer living in Portland, OR.  I love creating things with code from end to end.  My starter career was as a bartender and from there I moved into small business ownership. I have always had a focus on customer service and delivering for the the client.  I\'m an artist and a musician and really enjoy bringing that type creative energy to tech.  In my spare time I love to spend time with my family, whether that be at home or out in the beauty of Oregon.';
